# C3
**Flag:** 'adlibs'

## PROCEDURE
-I tried to reverse the algo in the encoder provided by changing the string.
-Took the character from lookup2 instead of lookup1
-changed cur-prev to cur+prev so that I add the value that was initially subtracted ig
-changed the value of prev from cur to (cur+prev)%40 to reverse the process 

'''
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"


out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  out += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
  prev = (cur+prev)%40

print(out)
'''

-ran the script received in output using Python2 as it mentioned python 2
-provided the script itself as the input to the script
-received the flag

## Concepts learned
1. Python
2. Mathematical application

## Incorrect Methods
1. Did not change the value of cur properly the first time
2. Provided the original cipher text as input to the second program
