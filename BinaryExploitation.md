# Format String 0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_dc0f36c4`
How you approached the challenge:
- Selected grilled cheese option as it has %114d which would be interpreted by the compiler as a 114 byte digit which is greater than the 64 in the if statement
- selected Cla%sic_Che%s%steak as the compiler would try to interpret %steak as %s which would lead to an error and give me the flag

```
Enter your recommendation: Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
ClaCla%sic_Che%s%steakic_Che(null)
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_dc0f36c4}
```
